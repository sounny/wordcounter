# Word Counter

A minimal static web application that counts the number of words in a block of text. This repository currently contains a single `index.html` file that implements the functionality using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Type or paste text into the provided textarea.
3. The app will display the word count automatically as you type.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML document containing embedded styles and script logic for the counter.
- `AGENTS.md` – Working memory log for AI contributors. Update this log with reasoning and notable actions during each session.

## Contributing

This project is maintained with the help of AI agents. When making changes:

- Review and update `AGENTS.md` with a summary of your actions and thought process.
- Follow any additional instructions documented in nested `AGENTS.md` files if they are added in the future.
- Ensure your changes are self-contained and well-documented.
