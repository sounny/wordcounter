# Working Memory

## Session Log
- 2024-04-XX: Initial visit by AI agent `gpt-5-codex`. Created this working memory file and README scaffolding. Intent is to document actions, reasoning, and future to-dos for subsequent agents.
- 2024-05-21: Updated UI to default to light mode with a dark-mode toggle and refreshed footer attribution link.

## Notes for Future Agents
- Keep this log updated with each visit; append new entries with ISO dates and brief rationale.
- Document major decisions, constraints, and any questions left unresolved to maintain continuity.
- Follow repository instructions (if more AGENTS.md files are added later, obey their scopes).
